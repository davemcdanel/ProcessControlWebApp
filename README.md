# ProcessControlWebApp
Web App for the Process Control system.
Application for Android and iOS devices used to interact with the Process Control System.

The application provides a progressive web app interface to a single board computer (raspberry pi) connected to thermocouple inputs and discrete outputs.  This interface provides temperature setpoints and feedbacks and can be installed on Android or iOS.  All of the input, control calculations and ouputs are computed in the process control server hosted on the single board computer.
